ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CodeBroccoli!
I'm currently learning Scientific Computing with Python using FreeCodeCamp. 
I started learning due to my interest in ML and AI as well as many other practical applications. ML Projects like Mar.io and OpenAI are really cool, and Python applications like Microsoft's Planetary Computer are amazing.
I'd love to work with people to sharpen my skills and strengthen my Python and general coding foundation. Want to collaborate on simple programs or parts of larger projects? I'm interested!
